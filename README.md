# socket-io-ios

Basic sample of Node.js server listening for connections using Socket.IO. Note that the server is using a simple middleware function that checks if the connection includes a query parameter "device". See example client in public/index.html for how connection is done.

Instructions:
* Clone repo
* cd into repo folder
* node index.js
* Open a browser and browse http://localhost:5000 for the example client
